#### jingo
This game is designed to bring fun and excitement to its players by combining chance, strategy, and anticipation.

Game Rules:

1. Each player works toward forming a winning pattern on their game card. The goal is to align five markers in a row — this can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally across the card.

2. Once a player successfully creates this sequence, they must immediately call out “Bingo!” to announce their win.

3. When “Bingo!” is declared, the Caller (the game’s moderator) verifies the claim. The Caller carefully checks the player’s marked card against the master tally card, ensuring that every number and letter the player marked has indeed been called during the game.

4. If the card is confirmed as accurate, the player is officially declared the winner. If not, the game continues until another player achieves a valid Bingo.
